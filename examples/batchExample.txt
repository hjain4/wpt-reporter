## Testing multiple pages can be done by running batch job
## Add the parameter --batch to your run with the value
## of the path and file name of the batch file

## A batch file have each test on one individual row
## taking all individual parameters as usual.

## One extra feature is that variables in your batch file named
## <%YOUR_OWN_VARIABLE%> will be substituted at runtime against the
## envirenment variable with the same name, meaning process.env.YOUR_OWN_VARIABLE

## If you want to test your script, the easiest Ã­s to supply the parameters
## in the command line:
## YOUR_OWN_VARIABLE=supersecretkey node lib/index.js /path/tp/batch.txt

## Your script can look like this (where WMF_WPT_KEY need to be an environment variable)

## Test the Facebook page 15 times
--webPageTestKey <%WMF_WPT_KEY> --runs 15 --median SpeedIndex https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook

## And then test Barack 31 and use SpeedIndex as median
--webPageTestKey <%WMF_WPT_KEY> --runs 31 --median SpeedIndex https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama
